# All About Me
## Quick Intro
Hey! I'm Kishan Namburi. I am currently a sophmore at Whitney High School (objectively the best school in California) and I am 15 years old. I am a classical music fanatic and have been learning to sing and play the violin for as long as I can remember. I also enjoy watching and playing sports (even though I am not good at sports like at all).
### The Specifics
I was born and brought up in LA and have been living here my whole life. Due to this, I have become a huge fan of all the LA sports teams. I am a Lakers and Rams fanatic, and watch the Dodgers games when I have time.
