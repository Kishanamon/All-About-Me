# All About Me
## Quick Intro
Hey! I'm Kishan Namburi. I am currently a sophmore at Whitney High School (objectively the best school in California) and I am 15 years old. I am a classical music fanatic and have been learning to sing and play the violin for as long as I can remember. I also enjoy watching and playing sports (even though I am not good at sports like at all).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Kishanamon/All-About-Me/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
